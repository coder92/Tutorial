INFO
	JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology.
	It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc.

The Lifecycle of a JSP Page
    Translation of JSP Page
    Compilation of JSP Page
    Classloading (the classloader loads class file)
    Instantiation (Object of the Generated Servlet is created).
    Initialization ( the container invokes jspInit() method).
    Request processing ( the container invokes _jspService() method).
    Destroy ( the container invokes jspDestroy() method).

    {
        <html>  
            <body>  
                <% out.print(2*5); %>  
            </body>  
        </html>
    }

JSP APIs
    The JSP API consists of two packages:
        javax.servlet.jsp
        javax.servlet.jsp.tagext
    javax.servlet.jsp
        JspPage Interface 
            public void jspInit(): It is invoked only once during the life cycle of the JSP when JSP page is requested firstly. It is used to perform initialization. It is same as the init() method of Servlet interface.
            public void jspDestroy(): It is invoked only once during the life cycle of the JSP before the JSP page is destroyed. It can be used to perform some clean up operation.
        HttpJspPage interface extends JspPage  
            public void _jspService(): It is invoked each time when request for the JSP page comes to the container. It is used to process the request. The underscore _ signifies that you cannot override this method.
