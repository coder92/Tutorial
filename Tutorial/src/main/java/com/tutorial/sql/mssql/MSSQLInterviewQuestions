3. What is recursive stored procedure?
    {
        SQL Server supports recursive stored procedure which calls by itself. 
        Recursive stored procedure can be defined as a method of problem solving wherein the solution is arrived repetitively. 
        It can nest up to 32 levels.

        Example
        {   
            CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Fact]
            (
            @Number Integer,
            @RetVal Integer OUTPUT
            )
            AS
            DECLARE @In Integer
            DECLARE @Out Integer
            IF @Number != 1
            BEGIN
            SELECT @In = @Number – 1
            EXEC Fact @In, @Out OUTPUT - Same stored procedure has been called again(Recursively)
            SELECT @RetVal = @Number * @Out
            END
            ELSE
            BEGIN
            SELECT @RetVal = 1
            END
            RETURN
            GO
