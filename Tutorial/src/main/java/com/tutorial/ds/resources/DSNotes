Tree
{
	Strict Binary Tree: A binary tree is called strict binary tree if each node has exactly two children or no children.
	Full Binary Tree: A binary tree is called full binary tree if each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
	Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree is called complete binary tree if all leaf nodes are at height h or h – 1 and also without any missing number in the sequence.

	Properties of Binary Trees:
		The number of nodes n in a full binary tree is 2h+1 – 1.
