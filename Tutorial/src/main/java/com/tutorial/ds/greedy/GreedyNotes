Greedy Applications
• Sorting: Selection sort, Topological sort
• Priority Queues: Heap sort
• Huffman coding compression algorithm
• Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms
• Shortest path in Weighted Graph [Dijkstra’s]
• Coin change problem
• Fractional Knapsack problem
• Disjoint sets-UNION by size and UNION by height (or rank)
• Job scheduling algorithm
• Greedy techniques can be used as an approximation algorithm for complex problems
