Gateway service (micro service)

A->Gateway1->(send msg to B)->Sessions->(check B in DB and send msg to Gateway 2->send it to B)->DB
B->Gateway2->Sessions->DB 
C->Gateway3->Sessions->DB

Note: HTTP is client to server protocol so from sending msg from db to B is not possible this way. 
	so one way is to use long polling (every few second B asks to server about any msgs)-> in real time -this is not meaningful.
	solution: TCP (Web sockets)
	sent msg to A (delieverd) from server

LastTime user active
	B->server->(when A last online)->keep this info in some db
	Last seen service 
	two type of msgs -> sent by user | app sent => user sent msgs should be going to last seen service
